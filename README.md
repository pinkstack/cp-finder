# cp-finder

Ultra-fast search and analytics engine purposely built for
[≈Ωejn GROUP](https://www.zejn.si/)

- [Codemania (TL - Hack) - hackathon, January 2021](https://tl-hack.incubatehub.com/p/codemania-tl-hack).

Detailed competition requirements and instructions can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Usage üöÄ

### Requirements

The service can run as [fat JAR](https://dzone.com/articles/the-skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber)
on top of any modern JRE or via pre-packaged Docker Image.

> üêá Although out of the scope of the assigment; this project can easily be compiled with GraalVM to also run as "native-image"; that would further reduce memory footprint and improve boot-up time and possibly performance.

on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) and put everything online.

$ sbt run

### Testsuite

To run the full testsuite including integration tests please run

$ sbt test

### Tooling
